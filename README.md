# GDSC-PyGame

Welcome to the PyGame Demo README. This README will be short and sweet, especially because there are so many comments in the actual code. As a rough guide I reccommend you read through `gameObjects.py` first, then `start.py` and then the rest. Though you might want to look at `spritesheet.py` as you are looking through `gameObjects.py`. Regardless I have most my stuff in `gameObjects.py`. Also I've made a `backround.py` file for you to mess around with the dynamic background and try to implement one yourselves. Though, I reccomend that being less of a priority: get the main functionality of your game working first. Good Luck to everyone, and happy coding (if that's even a thing).
